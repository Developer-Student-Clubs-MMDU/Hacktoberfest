## Before you contribute

Before you contribute to our repository, you must sign up for:

## Let's Contribute

1.  Fork this repository.

    You can make a copy of the project to your account. This process is called forking a project to your Github account. On Upper right side of project page on Github, you can see -

    Click on fork to create a copy of project to your account. This creates a separate copy for you to work on.

1.  Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

    You have forked the project you want to contribute to your github account. To get this project on your development machine, we use clone command of git. Open the terminal on your local machine or git bash.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/Hacktoberfest.git
    ```

    Now you have the project on your local machine.

1.  Create a new branch for a feature or bugfix provided in the Issues section of the repository.

    Usually, all repositories have a main branch that is regarded to be stable, and any new features should be developed on a separate branch before being merged into the main branch. As a result, we should establish a new branch for our feature or bugfix and go to work on the issue.

    ```
    $ git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME_HERE
    ```

    This will create a new branch out of master branch. Now start working on the problem and commit your changes.

1.  Add the changes to your repository.

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE_HERE"
    ```

    The first command adds all the files or you can add specific files by removing "_._" and adding the file names.
    The second command gives a message to your changes so you can know in future what changes this commit makes.

1.  Push code and create a pull request. And that's all.

    You now have a new branch containing the modifications you want in the project you forked. Now, push your new branch to your remote github fork.

    ```
    $ git push origin BRANCH_NAME_HERE
    ```

    Now you are ready to help the project by opening a pull request, means you now tell the project managers to add the feature or bug fix to original repository. You can open a pull request by clicking on green icon -

    Remember your upstream base branch should be main and source should be your feature branch. Click on create pull request and add a name to your pull request. You can also describe your feature.
