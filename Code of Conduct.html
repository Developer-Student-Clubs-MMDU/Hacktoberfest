      <p>
        Community leaders are accountable for clarifying and enforcing our
        standards of acceptable behavior and can take appropriate and fair
        corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
        inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Community leaders have the proper right and responsibility to get rid
        of, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and
        other contributions that don't seem to be aligned to the current Code of
        Conduct, and can communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
        appropriate.

        This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also
        applies when a personal is officially representing the community
        publically. Samples of representing our community include using a
        politician's e-mail address, posting via an officer's social media
        account, or acting as an appointed representative at a web or offline
        event.

        could also be reported to the community leaders answerable for
